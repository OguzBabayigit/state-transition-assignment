# State Transition Testing & Coverage - Take Home Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the take home assignment: an ATM state-transition model and a coverage analysis for the provided `is_shipping_free` function.

Structure:
- `state_transition/` – state table and diagram (Mermaid).
- `coverage/` – original `shipping.py`, tests, and coverage report.

How to run tests:
1. Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
2. From `coverage/` run: `pytest -q`

Notes:
- Diagrams are provided in Mermaid format (`.mmd`) for easy editing (draw.io can import/export Mermaid).
- All texts are short and in English as requested.
